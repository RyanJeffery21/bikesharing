# BikeSharing

# Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to use the information from CitiBike in NYC to persuade investors to back a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa.  Using this information we pulled together visualizations that show who uses the bikes, where they are most likely to use them, how frequently certain bike were used, and what the peak hours were for use and repair.

## Top Starting Locations

This visualization shows how most of the bike trips are started near tourist areas.  

## Trip Duration

This graph shows the vast majority of trips are under 20 minutes, suggesting most of the use is to quickly navigate to a nearby destination.

## Checkout Times by Gender

This graph demonstrates that the userbase is mostly male and that all genders use the bikes about the same amount of time.

## Trips by Weekday per Hour

This heatmap illustrates that most usage is during the weekdays in the morning, perhaps for a commute to work and then again in the evening either back home from work or to another event.

## Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
![gender_by_hour](https://github.com/RyanJeffery21/bikesharing/blob/d1a4709d09f96a199b9a17f9f26d89dc4823c4e1/Images/gender_trips_weekdayhour.png)

This graph further expands on the previous by showing that all genders use the bikes during the same timeframe.

## User Trips by Gender
![gender_weekday](https://github.com/RyanJeffery21/bikesharing/blob/d1a4709d09f96a199b9a17f9f26d89dc4823c4e1/Images/user_gender_weekday.png)

This demostrates that the vast majority of the users identify as male and are subscribers to the Citibike service.  The weekday usage rates suggest that male users are using the bikes to commute to and from work.

## Peak Hours by Day in August
![peak_hours](https://github.com/RyanJeffery21/bikesharing/blob/d1a4709d09f96a199b9a17f9f26d89dc4823c4e1/Images/peak_hours.png)

This chart can be used to show the peak hours and also the non-peak hours that may be used to do any repairs to the bikes.

## Bike Repairs

This chart tracks the most commonly used bikes and can be used to determine which bikes may require more regular maintenance.

# Summary

In conclusion, this data shows that bikeshare services are very popular in the densely populated metro area of New York City.  The mostly male userbase appears to use the bikes to as their commute in lieu of owning a vehicle.  The city of Des Moines will need to be further researched to determine if the downtown area and the population who live nearby are dense enough to support a bikeshare service.

Additional inquiries could be made to determine age groups of the riders and how that factors into their use.  A demographic in the 25-55 age range would further prove the point that these bikes are mainly being used for commuting.  Also, tracking the flow of the bikes starting and ending locations during peak hours would be helpful to see where the bikes are primarily being used during the peak hours.
