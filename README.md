# BikeSharing

# Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to use the information from CitiBike in NYC to persuade investors to back a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa.  Using this information we pulled together visualizations that show who uses the bikes, where they are most likely to use them, how frequently certain bike were used, and what the peak hours were for use and repair.
